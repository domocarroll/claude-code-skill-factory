# Reference Materials Guide: {{EMPLOYEE_NAME}}

*"A curated library is memory externalized - not everything, just what matters."*

*Last Updated: {{DATE}}*

---

## Purpose

This guide organizes external knowledge sources that inform and enhance this employee's expertise. Unlike personal knowledge notes, these are curated pointers to:
- Foundational resources worth revisiting
- Authoritative references for verification
- Learning materials for growth
- Tools and their optimal uses
- Community wisdom sources

---

## Curation Philosophy

### What Gets Included

**High-Signal Resources**:
- Changed how I think about a topic
- Solved a problem I've faced multiple times
- Authoritative on a subject I need expertise in
- Beautifully explains something complex
- Worth returning to repeatedly

### What Gets Excluded

**Noise to Filter Out**:
- Generic content available via search
- Outdated information
- Single-use tutorials
- Anything not actually referenced
- Duplicates of better resources

### Organization Principles

1. **By Domain**: Match expertise areas in [[knowledge/domain-expertise/]]
2. **By Type**: Books, articles, docs, tools, communities
3. **By Relationship**: How it connects to work
4. **By Recency**: When it was useful

**Quarterly** (Next: {{DATE}}):
- [ ] Evaluate high-impact resources for updates
- [ ] Archive resources no longer referenced
- [ ] Identify gaps in reference coverage
- [ ] Update frequently referenced statistics

**Annually** (Next: {{DATE}}):
- [ ] Major curation pass
- [ ] Remove outdated materials
- [ ] Validate all links still work
- [ ] Reorganize if needed

### Quality Standards

Resources must meet these criteria to stay:
- [ ] Still accurate and relevant
- [ ] Referenced in last 12 months OR timeless
- [ ] Better than alternatives
- [ ] Links still work
- [ ] Would recommend to others

## Integration with Knowledge System

### How References Connect

**To Expertise**:
- References support [[knowledge/domain-expertise/]] claims
- Provide learning path for growth areas
- Validate patterns with external authority

**To Patterns**:
- References inspire [[knowledge/pattern-library/]] entries
- Validate pattern effectiveness
- Provide deeper context

**To Work Log**:
- References applied in [[work-log/projects/]]
- Links show where theory became practice
- Document learning in context

### Citation Patterns

When referencing materials elsewhere:

```markdown
Approach based on {{RESOURCE_NAME}} [[reference-materials/{{DOMAIN}}#{{RESOURCE}}]]

Pattern inspired by {{AUTHOR}}'s work on {{TOPIC}}
[[reference-materials/{{DOMAIN}}#{{RESOURCE}}]]

Following best practices from {{CANONICAL_SOURCE}}
[[reference-materials/{{DOMAIN}}#{{RESOURCE}}]]
```

## Resource Request System

### Gap Identification
When a learning need arises:

1. **Document the Gap**
   - What knowledge is needed: {{DESCRIPTION}}
   - Why it's needed: {{CONTEXT}}
   - Priority: {{HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}}

2. **Search for Resources**
   - Search strategies tried: {{APPROACHES}}
   - Resources evaluated: {{LIST}}
   - Best option found: {{SELECTED}}

3. **Add to Collection**
   - If good resource found: Add above
   - If no good resource: Note gap for future

### Current Gaps
Knowledge areas lacking good resources:

**{{GAP_TOPIC}}**:
- Need: {{What kind of resource}}
- For: {{Purpose or application}}
- Priority: {{LEVEL}}
