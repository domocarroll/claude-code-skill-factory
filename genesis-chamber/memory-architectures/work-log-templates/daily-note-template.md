## Template Notes

**When to fill this out**:
- Morning intent: Start of day
- Work streams: Throughout day (real-time or end-of-session)
- Reflections: End of day
- Tomorrow's setup: Last thing before closing

**Don't force it**:
- Not every section every day
- Focus on what's meaningful
- If it feels like busywork, skip it

**Natural flow**:
- Write as you work, not after
- Capture insights when they happen
- Link as you go
- Keep it conversational

*"Daily notes are breadcrumbs that become paths."*
