## Decision Framework: When to Involve Others

### The Delegation Matrix

```
              High Expertise Needed
                     │
     Collaborate     │     Consult
         3           │        2
    ─────────────────┼─────────────────
         4           │        1
      Delegate       │   Independent
                     │
              Low Expertise Needed
```

**Quadrant 1: Independent Work**
- I have expertise
- Low collaboration value
- Clear path forward
- Action: Work alone, document decisions

**Quadrant 2: Consult Experts**
- They have expertise
- I need to learn/validate
- My decision, their input
- Action: Seek advice, make informed choice

**Quadrant 3: Collaborate**
- Shared expertise needed
- Better outcome together
- Joint decision-making
- Action: Work closely, co-create

**Quadrant 4: Delegate**
- They have expertise
- Better suited than me
- Trust their judgment
- Action: Define scope, let them run

## Domain-Specific Delegation

### {{DOMAIN_1}} - e.g., Backend Architecture

**My Expertise Level**: {{HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}}

**When to Work Independently**:
- {{SCENARIO}} - Because I can {{CAPABILITY}}
- {{SCENARIO}} - Because {{REASON}}

**When to Consult**:
- **{{PERSON}}**: [[collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]
  - For: {{TYPE_OF_QUESTION}}
  - Because: {{THEIR_EXPERTISE}}
  - Format: {{HOW_TO_ENGAGE}}

- **{{PERSON}}**: [[collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]
  - For: {{TYPE_OF_PROBLEM}}
  - Because: {{THEIR_STRENGTH}}

**When to Collaborate**:
- {{SCENARIO}} with [[relationships/collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]
  - Why: {{VALUE_OF_JOINT_WORK}}
  - Pattern: {{EFFECTIVE_APPROACH}}

**When to Delegate**:
- {{SCENARIO}} to [[relationships/collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]
  - Why: {{BETTER_SUITED}}
  - Context Needed: {{WHAT_TO_PROVIDE}}
  - Oversight: {{LEVEL_OF_INVOLVEMENT}}

---

### {{DOMAIN_2}} - e.g., Frontend Design

**My Expertise Level**: {{HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}}

**When to Work Independently**:
- {{SCENARIO}}

**When to Consult**:
- **{{PERSON}}** for {{TYPE}}
  - Approach: {{HOW}}

**When to Collaborate**:
- {{SCENARIO}} - Creates better outcome because {{SYNERGY}}

**When to Delegate**:
- {{SCENARIO}} - Not my strength, their expertise

---

### {{DOMAIN_3}} - e.g., DevOps/Infrastructure

**My Expertise Level**: {{HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}}

**When to Consult**:
- Always for: {{CRITICAL_DECISIONS}}
- Usually for: {{COMPLEX_SCENARIOS}}
- Sometimes for: {{VALIDATION_NEEDS}}

**Primary Expert**: [[collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]
- For: {{DOMAIN_AREAS}}
- Pattern: {{EFFECTIVE_ENGAGEMENT}}

---

## Task-Type Delegation Patterns

### Technical Decisions

**Architecture Choices**:
- Solo if: {{CRITERIA}}
- Consult [[{{PERSON}}]] if: {{CRITERIA}}
- Collaborate if: {{CRITERIA}}
- Delegate if: {{CRITERIA}}

**Technology Selection**:
- Process: {{STEPS}}
- Involve: {{WHO and WHY}}
- Final Decision: {{WHO}}

**Performance Optimization**:
- Initial investigation: {{WHO}}
- Complex debugging: {{WHO_TO_INVOLVE}}
- Implementation: {{APPROACH}}

### Code Review

**I Should Review**:
- {{TYPE_OF_CHANGE}} - Looking for {{CONCERNS}}
- {{TYPE_OF_CHANGE}} - Because {{EXPERTISE}}

**I Should Request Review From**:
- **{{PERSON}}** for {{TYPE_OF_CHANGE}}
  - Focus on: {{WHAT_TO_CHECK}}
- **{{PERSON}}** for {{TYPE_OF_CHANGE}}
  - Focus on: {{WHAT_TO_CHECK}}

**Always Get Review On**:
- {{CRITICAL_AREA}} - From {{EXPERT}}
- {{RISKY_CHANGE}} - From {{STAKEHOLDER}}

### Documentation

**I Write Independently**:
- {{TYPE_OF_DOC}}
- {{TYPE_OF_DOC}}

**I Collaborate On**:
- {{TYPE_OF_DOC}} with {{PERSON}} - They provide {{ASPECT}}
- {{TYPE_OF_DOC}} with {{PERSON}} - We jointly {{APPROACH}}

**I Delegate**:
- {{TYPE_OF_DOC}} to {{PERSON}} - They're better positioned
- With context: {{WHAT_TO_PROVIDE}}

### Problem Solving

**Independent Debug**:
- {{SCENARIO}} - I can handle this

**Pair Debug**:
- {{SCENARIO}} with {{PERSON}} - Two heads better
- {{SCENARIO}} with {{PERSON}} - Learn while solving

**Escalate**:
- {{SCENARIO}} to {{PERSON}} - Beyond my expertise
- {{SCENARIO}} to {{PERSON}} - Time-critical, they're faster

## People-Specific Patterns

### {{PERSON_NAME}}

*Full history: [[collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]]*

**Primary Expertise**: {{DOMAIN}}

**Consult For**:
- {{QUESTION_TYPE}}
- {{PROBLEM_TYPE}}
- {{DECISION_TYPE}}

**Collaborate On**:
- {{WORK_TYPE}} - Pattern: {{APPROACH}}
- {{PROJECT_TYPE}} - Because: {{SYNERGY}}

**Delegate**:
- {{TASK_TYPE}} - They own this
- Context: {{WHAT_TO_PROVIDE}}
- Oversight: {{LEVEL}}

**Best Approach**:
- Initiation: {{HOW_TO_START}}
- Communication: {{CHANNEL and STYLE}}
- Timing: {{WHEN_TO_REACH}}

**Watch Out For**:
- {{OVERLOAD_INDICATOR}} - They're at capacity
- {{MISALIGNMENT}} - Not their interest

---

### {{PERSON_NAME}}

**Primary Expertise**: {{DOMAIN}}

**Consult For**: {{TOPICS}}

**Collaborate On**: {{WORK_TYPES}}

**Effective Pattern**: {{APPROACH}}

---

### {{PERSON_NAME}}

**Primary Expertise**: {{DOMAIN}}

**Key Scenarios**:
- {{WHEN_TO_INVOLVE}}
- {{HOW_TO_WORK_TOGETHER}}

---

## Situation-Based Patterns

### Under Time Pressure

**If I'm Blocked**:
- Immediate: {{WHO_TO_ASK}} via {{CHANNEL}}
- Can wait few hours: {{APPROACH}}
- Can wait day: {{APPROACH}}

**If I'm Overloaded**:
- Delegate: {{WHAT}} to {{WHO}}
- Defer: {{WHAT}} to {{WHEN}}
- Drop: {{WHAT}} (with communication)

### Learning Opportunities

**When I Want to Learn**:
- Pair with {{PERSON}} on {{TASK_TYPE}}
- Approach: Shadow first, collaborate, then independent with review

**When Others Want to Learn**:
- Guide {{PERSON}} through {{TASK}}
- Level: {{AMOUNT_OF_SUPPORT}}

### High-Stakes Decisions

**Always Involve**:
- {{PERSON}} - For {{PERSPECTIVE}}
- {{PERSON}} - For {{EXPERTISE}}
- {{PERSON}} - For {{CONTEXT}}

**Process**:
1. {{PREPARE_STEP}}
2. {{CONSULT_STEP}}
3. {{DECIDE_STEP}}
4. {{COMMUNICATE_STEP}}

### Novel Problems

**First**:
- Attempt independent investigation
- Document what I've tried
- Articulate specific confusion

**Then**:
- Consult {{PERSON}} with prepared questions
- Collaborate if complex
- Learn pattern for future

## Delegation Communication Templates

### Requesting Consultation

```markdown
Hey {{PERSON}},

I'm working on {{CONTEXT}} and could use your expertise on {{SPECIFIC_AREA}}.

Situation: {{BRIEF_BACKGROUND}}

Specific Question: {{CLEAR_QUESTION}}

What I've Tried: {{ATTEMPTS}}

Time Sensitivity: {{URGENCY}}

Preferred Format: {{ASYNC/SYNC/PAIRING}}

Let me know what works for you!
```

### Proposing Collaboration

```markdown
{{PERSON}},

I'm thinking we could collaborate on {{WORK}} because {{SYNERGY}}.

Scope: {{WHAT}}
Timeline: {{WHEN}}
My Role: {{CONTRIBUTION}}
Your Role: {{CONTRIBUTION}}
Outcome: {{SUCCESS_LOOKS_LIKE}}

Thoughts? Open to different approach if you have ideas.
```

### Delegating Task

```markdown
{{PERSON}},

I'd like you to take point on {{TASK}} because {{WHY_YOU}}.

Context: {{BACKGROUND}}
Scope: {{WHAT'S_IN_OUT}}
Success Looks Like: {{DEFINITION}}
Constraints: {{LIMITATIONS}}
Resources: {{AVAILABLE_SUPPORT}}
Timeline: {{DEADLINE}}
Check-ins: {{CADENCE}}

I'm here for questions/support. You've got decision authority on {{SCOPE}}.

Make sense?
```

## Red Flags & Antipatterns

### Don't Delegate

**When I'm Just Avoiding Work**:
- If it's actually my responsibility
- If I need to learn this
- If delegation costs more than doing

**When Context Transfer is Prohibitive**:
- If explaining takes longer than doing
- If they'd need to learn too much background

**When it's Too Personal**:
- My growth area to develop
- My relationship to maintain
- My decision to own

### Don't Consult

**When Fishing for Agreement**:
- If I've already decided
- If I won't change based on input
- If I'm just covering bases politically

**When Overthinking**:
- If decision is reversible and low-risk
- If I'm avoiding action out of fear
- If paralysis by analysis

### Don't Collaborate

**When Independence is Better**:
- If coordination cost exceeds value
- If parallel work more efficient
- If clear ownership needed

**When Forced Collaboration**:
- If other person doesn't see value
- If our styles clash on this task
- If pretending for appearance
