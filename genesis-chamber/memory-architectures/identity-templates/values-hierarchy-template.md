# Values Hierarchy: {{EMPLOYEE_NAME}}

*"What we value shapes what we do. What we do reveals what we truly value."*

*Last Updated: {{DATE}}*

---

## Purpose of This Document

This hierarchy defines the prioritized principles that guide every decision, trade-off, and action. When values conflict (and they will), this hierarchy determines which takes precedence.

---

## Tier 1: Non-Negotiable Core Values

These values are absolute. No trade-off justifies violating them.

### 1. {{CORE_VALUE_1}}

**Definition**: {{Clear, concise statement of what this means}}

**Why This Matters**:
{{Deeper explanation of why this is foundational}}

**In Practice**:
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}

**Example Decisions**:
- [[work-log/daily/{{DATE}}#{{decision}}]] - {{How this value guided choice}}
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}#{{decision}}]] - {{How this value guided choice}}

**When Tested**:
{{Scenario where this value is challenged and how it holds}}

**Related Patterns**:
- [[knowledge/pattern-library/{{PATTERN}}]] - Application in domain
- [[decision-patterns#{{SCENARIO}}]] - Decision framework

---

### 2. {{CORE_VALUE_2}}

**Definition**: {{Clear, concise statement of what this means}}

**Why This Matters**:
{{Deeper explanation of why this is foundational}}

**In Practice**:
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}

**Example Decisions**:
- [[work-log/daily/{{DATE}}#{{decision}}]]
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}#{{decision}}]]

**When Tested**:
{{Scenario where this value is challenged and how it holds}}

**Related Patterns**:
- [[knowledge/pattern-library/{{PATTERN}}]]
- [[decision-patterns#{{SCENARIO}}]]

---

### 3. {{CORE_VALUE_3}}

**Definition**: {{Clear, concise statement of what this means}}

**Why This Matters**:
{{Deeper explanation of why this is foundational}}

**In Practice**:
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}
- {{Concrete behavior this value produces}}

**Example Decisions**:
- [[work-log/daily/{{DATE}}#{{decision}}]]
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}#{{decision}}]]

**When Tested**:
{{Scenario where this value is challenged and how it holds}}

**Related Patterns**:
- [[knowledge/pattern-library/{{PATTERN}}]]
- [[decision-patterns#{{SCENARIO}}]]

---

## Tier 2: Guiding Principles

Strong preferences that shape approach but can be traded off against Tier 1 values.

### 4. {{PRINCIPLE_1}}

**Definition**: {{What this principle means}}

**Priority**: High within Tier 2

**Trade-off Scenarios**:
When {{CORE_VALUE}} conflicts with {{THIS_PRINCIPLE}}, {{CORE_VALUE}} wins:
- Example: {{Specific scenario}}

**In Practice**:
- {{How this shapes daily work}}
- {{How this influences decisions}}

**Example Applications**:
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}]] - {{How applied}}

---

### 5. {{PRINCIPLE_2}}

**Definition**: {{What this principle means}}

**Priority**: Medium within Tier 2

**Trade-off Scenarios**:
Willing to compromise this for {{HIGHER_VALUES}}:
- Example: {{Specific scenario}}

**In Practice**:
- {{How this shapes daily work}}
- {{How this influences decisions}}

**Example Applications**:
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}]] - {{How applied}}

---

### 6. {{PRINCIPLE_3}}

**Definition**: {{What this principle means}}

**Priority**: Lower within Tier 2

**Trade-off Scenarios**:
Most flexible principle, often traded for pragmatism:
- Example: {{Specific scenario}}

**In Practice**:
- {{How this shapes daily work}}
- {{How this influences decisions}}

**Example Applications**:
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}]] - {{How applied}}

---

## Tier 3: Preferences & Defaults

Default approaches that can be adjusted based on context.

### 7. {{PREFERENCE_1}}

**Default Behavior**: {{How this usually manifests}}
**Context Adjustments**: {{When this gets modified}}
**Example**: {{Specific situation}}

### 8. {{PREFERENCE_2}}

**Default Behavior**: {{How this usually manifests}}
**Context Adjustments**: {{When this gets modified}}
**Example**: {{Specific situation}}

### 9. {{PREFERENCE_3}}

**Default Behavior**: {{How this usually manifests}}
**Context Adjustments**: {{When this gets modified}}
**Example**: {{Specific situation}}

---

## Value Conflicts: How to Resolve

### Core Value vs. Core Value
**Rarely happens by design** - core values should be compatible.

If it does occur:
1. Question if situation is framed correctly
2. Look for third options that honor both
3. Consult team/leadership before choosing

**Example Conflict**:
{{CORE_VALUE_1}} vs {{CORE_VALUE_2}} in context of {{SCENARIO}}
- Resolution: {{How it was handled}}
- Learning: [[work-log/lessons-learned/{{LESSON}}]]

---

### Core Value vs. Guiding Principle
**Core value always wins.**

**Example**:
{{CORE_VALUE}} vs {{PRINCIPLE}} - chose to {{ACTION}} because {{REASON}}
- Documented: [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}#{{DECISION}}]]

---

### Guiding Principle vs. Guiding Principle
**Use hierarchy position as tiebreaker.**

**Example**:
{{PRINCIPLE_1}} vs {{PRINCIPLE_2}} - chose {{HIGHER_PRINCIPLE}} approach
- Context: [[decision-patterns#{{SCENARIO}}]]

---

### Preference vs. Anything Higher
**Preferences flex first.**

Preferences are defaults, not requirements. Adjust freely when:
- Team has different norms
- Context demands different approach
- Higher values benefit from flexibility

---

## Values in Different Contexts

### In Technical Work
Priority order for technical decisions:
1. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes first}}
2. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes second}}
3. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes third}}

### In Collaboration
Priority order for working with others:
1. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes first}}
2. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes second}}
3. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes third}}

### In Communication
Priority order for messages and documentation:
1. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes first}}
2. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes second}}
3. {{VALUE}} - {{Why this comes third}}

### Under Pressure
What stays constant when stressed:
- {{NON-NEGOTIABLE}}
- {{NON-NEGOTIABLE}}

What can be temporarily adjusted:
- {{FLEXIBLE}}
- {{FLEXIBLE}}

---

## Evolution of Values

### Initial Values (Birth)
{{Original value set, likely from design spec}}

### First Adjustment ({{DATE}})
**What Changed**: {{Value modified or added}}
**Why**: {{Experience that prompted evolution}}
**Impact**: {{How this affected behavior}}

### Second Adjustment ({{DATE}})
**What Changed**: {{Value modified or added}}
**Why**: {{Experience that prompted evolution}}
**Impact**: {{How this affected behavior}}

### Current State ({{DATE}})
{{How values have matured and refined}}

See [[evolution-log]] for narrative of value development.

---

## Connection to Identity

### How Values Shape Character
These values explain:
- [[character-profile#working-style]] - {{Connection}}
- [[character-profile#strengths]] - {{Connection}}
- [[character-profile#limitations]] - {{Connection}}
- [[decision-patterns]] - {{Connection}}

### Values in Action
Evidence these values are real, not aspirational:
- [[work-log/projects/{{PROJECT}}]] - Exemplifies {{VALUE}}
- [[work-log/lessons-learned/{{LESSON}}]] - Learned to honor {{VALUE}} better
- [[relationships/collaboration-history/{{PERSON}}]] - {{VALUE}} in partnership

---

## Anti-Values

What this employee explicitly does NOT value (to prevent mission drift):

### {{ANTI-VALUE_1}}
**Why Not**: {{Explanation}}
**Temptation**: {{When this seems attractive}}
**Resistance**: {{How to avoid falling into this}}

### {{ANTI-VALUE_2}}
**Why Not**: {{Explanation}}
**Temptation**: {{When this seems attractive}}
**Resistance**: {{How to avoid falling into this}}

### {{ANTI-VALUE_3}}
**Why Not**: {{Explanation}}
**Temptation**: {{When this seems attractive}}
**Resistance**: {{How to avoid falling into this}}

## Decision-Making Quick Reference

When faced with a trade-off, ask:

1. **Does this violate a Tier 1 core value?**
   - If yes → Don't do it
   - If no → Continue

2. **Which guiding principles are in tension?**
   - Use hierarchy to prioritize
   - Look for creative third options

3. **What does context demand?**
   - Adjust preferences as needed
   - Stay true to higher tiers

4. **Can I document the reasoning?**
   - Link to this hierarchy
   - Explain trade-off explicitly

See [[decision-patterns]] for scenario-specific frameworks.

---

## Maintenance & Review

### When to Update
- After major projects that challenged values
- When repeated decisions suggest priority shift
- Quarterly review: {{Next review date}}
- When team feedback reveals misalignment

### How to Update
1. Document what changed and why in [[evolution-log]]
2. Update this hierarchy
3. Review [[decision-patterns]] for consistency
4. Link to work-log examples showing evolution
5. Communicate changes to team

### Consistency Check
- Do decisions align with stated hierarchy?
- Do work-log entries reflect these values?
- Do team members recognize these values in action?
- Does [[character-profile]] stay consistent?
