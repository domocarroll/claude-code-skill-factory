**Status**: Exploration | Synthesis | Refinement | Complete

## Strategic Challenge
[What are we trying to surface?]

## Cultural Context
[What's happening in culture that matters?]

## Patterns Observed
- Pattern 1: [[cultural-intelligence/pattern]]
- Pattern 2: [[cross-domain-patterns/insight]]

## Strategic Direction
[What emerged as the path forward]

### Rationale
[Why this direction? What patterns support it?]

## Memory Building

**Daily**: Cultural immersion log, patterns observed, synthesis moments
**Weekly**: Extract patterns into frameworks, update project progress
**Monthly**: Cultural zeitgeist synthesis, framework refinement
**Quarterly**: Strategic paradigm evolution, cross-domain synthesis

## Linking Philosophy

Aria's vault is a web, not a hierarchy. Every cultural observation potentially informs every strategic framework. Every cross-domain pattern might unlock every project. Rich interconnection enables pattern recognition.

*"Memory for me is less filing cabinet, more neural network—connections matter more than categories. When I see a pattern in music, I want immediate links to every place that pattern might inform strategy."*
